USAF Veteran [James Sanders](http://www.jamessanders.us/) and his Cornelius, NC based technology solutions company, [Shared Resources of NC, LLC](http://www.sronc.com/), donates this website upgrade in support of the growth and marketing of the Price of Freedom Museum.

"I am proud to volunteer my resources to support such a worthy cause." says James. "This museum displays many uniforms and items I once stored in the attic, far away from anyone's chances to enjoy. In return for the honor of a public celebration of my family's military service, I wanted to help grow the museum's visibility. This website is my way of supporting everyone's better understanding of the Price of Freedom."
